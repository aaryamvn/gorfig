# Gorfig (WIP)

### **Brief Overview**

A simple discord bot that allows you to obtain all the role, channel, sticker, or emoji data of a discord guild in key-value pairs (supports ts, js, and py).

### **How is this useful?**

**When you're** building a tool or a bot for a discord server, it's likely you'll need to work with common features like roles, channels, stickers, or emojis.

**In order to do so**, you'll need access to some specific data for said feature(s). This data is usually extracted manually and is a very time consuming process.

**For example**, if you needed the IDs and Names of every single role in your guild, manually obtaining it is most certainly a pain.

**This is where Gorfig comes in.** Simply add the bot to the respective guild, and run a singular command to get all the data for roles, channels, emojis, or stickers in a key-value pair format for a language of choice (typescript, javascript, python).

### **History behind the name**
